## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list) as part of the JavaScript section of the course.

The goal of the project was to create a to-do list web application, which allowed users to create, read, update, and delete projects and associated to-do lists.

This project wrapped up the section on organizing JavaScript code and as such a focus was put on writing clean, object-oriented JavaScript code. Through this project, constructors and factory functions were used to create projects and the associated to-do lists. Focus was put towards making sure that DOM related functionality and the application logic remained separated to make it easier to debug, refactor, and add additional features.

The current iteration of the to-do list does not store data within a database but instead uses the browsers Local Storage and the JavaScript localStorage API. As such, to-do lists will persist within the same browser but are not currently accessible from multiple computers.

## Next Steps

While the app is fully functional, there are a number of potential improvements which I am currently working on implementing in my free time.

As is, to-dos are displayed in the order in which you create them. Currently working on implementing the ability to sort to-do lists by date or priority. Additionally, While you can look through each of your individual projects, I am currently working on a calendar view, which would display all upcoming to-dos by date.

Not currently in development but would be nice to have in the future would be the ability to create recurring to-dos for events which happen on a regular schedule.
